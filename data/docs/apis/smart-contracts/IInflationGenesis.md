```solidity
function receiveMinting(
) external payable;
```

Receive newly minted native tokens from the [`FlareDaemon`](./FlareDaemon.md).

Assume that the received amount will be >= last topup requested across all services.
If there is not enough balance sent to cover the topup request, expect the library method to revert.
Also assume that any received balance greater than the calculated topup request
came from self-destructor sending a balance to this contract.

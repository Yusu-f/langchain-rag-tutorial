# Deploying a Validator Node

Deploy validator nodes to participate in consensus and collect rewards that the network provides to those who help secure it.

As explained in the [Validator Nodes](../../tech/validators.md) page, they are servers that fulfill a critical role in securing the network.
They:

* Check that all received [transactions](glossary.md#transaction) are valid.
* Run a [consensus](glossary.md#consensus) algorithm so that all validators in the network agree on the transactions to add to the blockchain.
* Finally, add the agreed-upon transactions to their copy of the [ledger](glossary.md#ledger).

Additionally, all blockchains employ certain measures against [Sybil attacks](glossary.md#sybil_resistance).
In this regard, Flare validators must:

* Be associated with an [FTSO Data Provider](glossary.md#data_provider).
    The performance of the data provider has an impact on the validation rewards.
* Stake native tokens, as in [Proof of Stake](glossary.md#proof_of_stake).
    See any of the [staking guides](../../user/staking/index.md) to learn how to do it and the minimum amount required.

To maintain decentralization, these limits apply:

* A single FTSO data provider can be associated with up to 4 validators, each with its own stake and each claiming their own rewards.
    Each validator can be associated with only one FTSO provider.
* The [staking cap](../../user/staking/index.md#limits) on each validators' rewards is 5% of the total staked funds on the network.

!!! info "The following instructions apply to the Flare network only. Validators on Songbird are managed by the Flare Foundation."

## Prerequisites

Validators run the same software as regular **observer nodes**, therefore, this guide assumes you have already read the [Deploying an Observer Node](../observation/deploying.md) guide.

The requirements to deploy a validator node are the same as for observer nodes, except on the CPU and RAM front which are heavier due to the extra work required:

|                 | Hardware    |                      | Software                                             |
| --------------: | :---------- | -------------------: | ---------------------------------------------------- |
|   **CPU cores** | 16          | **Operating System** | Ubuntu (18.04 or 20.04) or macOS (>= 10.15 Catalina) |
|         **RAM** | 64 GB       |     **Dependencies** | [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (>= 1.18.5)     |
|  **Disk space** | 1 TB SSD    |                      | [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/)                          |
| **Disk growth** | 2.5 TB/year |                      | [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/)                          |
|                 |             |                      | [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)                 |
|                 |             |                      | [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com) (>= 8.11)              |

## Guide

A validator node is deployed like an observer node, but there are some additional considerations.

Firstly, validators do more work than plain observer nodes so please consider the recommended **hardware specifications** above.

And secondly, validator **security** impacts the whole network, so configure the node for security, as follows, before running it.

### 1. Configure the Node

Please consider the following security items carefully:

#### Mandatory security measures

* Ensure port 9650 is not externally reachable.
    This is the port used to answer API requests and validators should not be doing that.

* Disallow password authentication over SSH.

* Don't run any non-validator services on the same IP (website, mail server, etc).

!!! warning
    A monitoring tool run by Flare periodically checks that the above measures are followed by all validators.

    Failure to comply impacts the validator's rewards.

#### Suggested security measures

* Disallow any ICMP traffic.

* Have the machine **firewalled**.
  Only the ports required for validator operation should be open (i.e. only the staking port, which defaults to 9651).

    If you use a virtual server, use only its web interface for management and close the SSH port.

    If the SSH port must be open, it should ideally be restricted to a private IP (i.e. only accessible through VPN) or only temporarily open to the operator's office/home static IP or a bastion SSH VM that can be turned off between use.

* The node should **only act as a validator**, and not accept RPC API calls.

    You should deploy a separate observer node for tasks requiring RPC API access.
    Additionally, this observer node can point to your validator for peering and bootstrapping.

* The validator should only enable the minimum set of [EVM](glossary.md#evm) APIs by adding this line to a [configuration file](../observation/deploying.md#additional-configuration):

    ```json
    "eth-apis": [
        "web3"
    ]
    ```

    ??? example "Sample configuration file for validator nodes"

        ```json
        {
            "snowman-api-enabled": false,
            "coreth-admin-api-enabled": false,

            "offline-pruning-data-directory": ""
        }
        ```

### 2. Run the Node

After taking the above considerations into account, you can now start up your node by following the [Deploying an Observation Node](../observation/deploying.md) guide.

!!! info "Preregistered validator keys"

    Some users have received **preregistered validator keys**, this is, the keys required to deploy a node which has already been registered as a validator.

    If that is your case, you just need to add these parameters to the launch command line:

    ```bash
    --staking-tls-cert-file=<NODE_CRT_PATH> \
    --staking-tls-key-file=<NODE_KEY_PATH>
    ```

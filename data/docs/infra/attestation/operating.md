# Operating an Attestation Provider

Anyone can operate an attestation provider without any capital requirement (see the [attestation-client repository](https://github.com/flare-foundation/attestation-client) for deployment information), which can readily be used as a **local provider** on validators that trust it.

To be included in the [default set](../../tech/state-connector.md#attestation-provider-sets), though, the same operator must run one of the **top-performing [FTSO](glossary.md#ftso) data providers** to prove its commitment to the network's well-being.
More details will be added soon.

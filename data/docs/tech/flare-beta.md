# Flare Beta

Decentralization will be achieved by moving the transaction validation duty **from the Flare Foundation to community-run FTSO** [data providers](glossary.md#data_provider), but this will not happen instantly.

Instead, to ensure a safe transition, a number of **professional validators** were initially enabled and continue to be employed.

The professional validators were chosen among companies with proven experience running blockchain infrastructure and **at first held most of the validation power**.
This power, though, will be **progressively shifted** onto the community-run validators until they run the network on their own.

This initial period is called **Flare Beta**, and it will span several [launch phases](./archive/flare-launch-process.md).

## Flare Beta Details

The Flare Beta began at the same time as the token distribution event (TDE).

During this period:

* 20 total validators **with equal validation power** (20K FLR each, initially) are enabled.
    * 4 run by the Flare Foundation.
    * 16 run by 4 professional validators.

* Each FTSO running an observation node will be a candidate to become a validator node later. These nodes are regularly scanned to ensure they meet security standards. If they meet the security standards, they enable the node operators to receive rewards.

* Validator rewards are split 50% for the professional validators and 50% for the FTSOs running observation nodes.

* Estimated duration: 6 - 9 months, depending on the evolution of the network.

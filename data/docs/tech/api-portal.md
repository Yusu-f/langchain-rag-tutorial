# Flare API Portal

Flare's API Portal is a paid product that gives developers access to a number of **private nodes** running on different blockchains, including Flare, [Songbird](glossary.md#songbird) and [Coston](glossary.md#coston), but also other networks like Bitcoin or XRPL.

These nodes are **not rate-limited**, so it is typically **more convenient** to connect your apps to them than to deploy your own nodes, or connect to public nodes.

This is one more step towards Flare's goal to **connect all blockchains**.

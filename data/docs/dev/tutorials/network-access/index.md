# Accessing the Network

The following tutorials deal with common problems encountered when accessing the Flare networks, like sending transactions or reading events.

!!! warning "Only EVM versions up to London are currently supported"

    All Flare networks support only EVM versions up to London.

    Learn how to set the EVM version in your compiler in [the Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/using-the-compiler.html#setting-the-evm-version-to-target).
    [Example of how to do this using Hardhat](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-hardhat-starter/blob/master/hardhat.config.ts#L32).

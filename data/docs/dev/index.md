All Flare networks are a fork of the Avalanche project, which runs the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](glossary.md#evm).
Therefore, all Ethereum contracts and tools work on Flare, Songbird and Coston.

All Flare networks are layer-1 networks, and run independently of both Avalanche and Ethereum.

You can interact with the Flare networks using [wallets](../user/wallets/index.md), [block explorers](../user/block-explorers/index.md) and the most common blockchain [development environments](./getting-started/setup/index.md).

As an example, all Flare networks support [NFTs](glossary.md#nft) and many have already been created on Songbird.
The [block explorer](../user/block-explorers/index.md) also supports displaying NFTs.

Once you have [set up your development environment](./getting-started/setup/index.md), you can start with the [Accessing the Network](./tutorials/network-access/index.md) tutorials.

## Open-Source Repositories

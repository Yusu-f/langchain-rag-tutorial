# Get Started Building

The following collections of guides provide information to quickly start developing on the Flare networks.

!!! warning "Only EVM versions up to London are currently supported"

    All Flare networks support only EVM versions up to London.

    Learn how to set the EVM version in your compiler in [the Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/using-the-compiler.html#setting-the-evm-version-to-target).
    [Example of how to do this using Hardhat](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-hardhat-starter/blob/master/hardhat.config.ts#L32).
